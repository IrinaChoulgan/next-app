This is a small web app(the funnel) consisting of 2 pages:

1. The first page is made according to the layout, consists of a 3-steps form.The last step saves the form data.

2. The second web page contain the list with the information submitted from the first page`s form(There was no design for this page, so I selected the design for the first page of the app).

3. The design - mobile first. There is also desktop version.
